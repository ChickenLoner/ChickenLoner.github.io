# Create & Polish Certification Review

Creates a complete, styled certification review page from a Notion/Markdown export, following the site's established patterns.

## Inputs to gather

Before starting, confirm:
1. **Export path** — directory with the `.md` file and images (e.g., `export_from_notion/psap-review`). If not provided, ask.
2. **Slug** — URL folder name for the review (e.g., `psap`, `cdsa`). Derive from the export dir name if obvious, otherwise ask.
3. **reviews.json entry** — check `data/reviews.json` first. If the entry already exists (`"url": "/reviews/<slug>/index.html"`), its metadata is the source of truth. If missing, ask the user for: title, excerpt, date, readTime, tags, difficulty, rating.

---

## Step 1 — Read the export

1. List the export directory — find the `.md` file and all image files.
2. Read the markdown fully. Build a precise map of:
   - All H2 headings (→ sections)
   - All H3 headings (→ subsections)
   - Every paragraph, bullet list, numbered list, blockquote
   - **Every image reference and its exact surrounding context** — which paragraph comes before it, which comes after. Image position is intentional and must be preserved exactly.
3. Identify the hero/cover image — typically `<slug>.jpg` or a standalone image at the very top of the document before any text. It does NOT get a Figure number.

---

## Step 2 — Prepare assets

1. Create `reviews/<slug>/` directory.
2. Copy all images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, etc.) from the export directory to `reviews/<slug>/`, renaming them as follows:
   - **Hero/cover image** → `cover.png` (or `cover.jpg` if the source is JPEG)
   - **All other images** → `image-1.png`, `image-2.png`, … `image-N.png` in the order they appear in the markdown (top to bottom). Keep the original extension.
3. Use these renamed filenames in all `<Fig src="...">` references in the HTML — never use Notion hash filenames like `09a09d2ac97a87abec4ff8f9bca6ce64.png`.
4. Verify copy: `ls reviews/<slug>/` should show `cover.*`, `image-1.*` … `image-N.*` and `index.html`.

---

## Step 3 — Sync reviews.json

- Read `data/reviews.json`.
- If an entry with `"url": "/reviews/<slug>/index.html"` exists → use its `title`, `rating`, `difficulty`, `date`, `readTime`, `tags`. Do not overwrite it.
- If no entry exists → add one at the top of the array:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "...",
    "excerpt": "...",
    "date": "...",
    "readTime": "...",
    "tags": [...],
    "url": "/reviews/<slug>/index.html",
    "image": "/assets/badges/<slug>.png",
    "difficulty": "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced",
    "rating": 0.0
  }
  ```
  Use `0.0` for rating if the user hasn't decided yet — it renders as no stars rather than crashing.

---

## Step 4 — Build `reviews/<slug>/index.html`

Use `reviews/psap/index.html` as the canonical reference for structure, components, and dark mode CSS. Do not diverge from its patterns without a reason.

### 4a. Head section

```html
<title>[Review Title] | Chicken0248</title>
<meta name="description" content="..." />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Chicken0248" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://chickenloner.github.io/reviews/<slug>/" />
<meta property="og:title" content="..." />
<meta property="og:description" content="..." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://chickenloner.github.io/reviews/<slug>/<cover-image>" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@Chicken_0248" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="..." />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="..." />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://chickenloner.github.io/reviews/<slug>/<cover-image>" />
<link rel="icon" href="/chicken0248.png" type="image/png">
```

Meta tags are **required** on every page — this was a site-wide instruction from the owner.

### 4b. Dark mode CSS

Copy the full dark mode `<style>` block from `reviews/psap/index.html` verbatim. It covers all amber/orange color variants used in the review theme. Add any extra color overrides if the content needs them (e.g., if the review has green/red badge elements).

**Do NOT add a Tailwind CDN `<script>` tag.** Detail pages use `soc.css` utility equivalents instead.

### 4c. React components

All review pages load shared components from `window.SocComponents`. Include the script tag **before** the `type="text/babel"` script, and destructure at the top of the Babel script:

```html
<!-- In <head>, after lucide script -->
<script src="/themes/soc-components.js"></script>
```

```js
// Top of <script type="text/babel">
const { SocClock, Icon, Section, Fig, resetFigCount, TipList, B, A, Code } = window.SocComponents;
```

| Source | Component | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `window.SocComponents` | `Icon` | Lucide icon wrapper using `useRef` + `useEffect` |
| `window.SocComponents` | `SocClock` | Live UTC clock |
| `window.SocComponents` | `Section` | H2 section with icon, scroll anchor, `res-section` class |
| `window.SocComponents` | `Fig` | Figure with auto-incrementing counter — shows **only "Figure N"**, no caption text. Image uses `max-w-full mx-auto block` so small screenshots render at natural size |
| `window.SocComponents` | `resetFigCount` | Resets figure counter — call as **first line inside `App()`** |
| `window.SocComponents` | `TipList` | Styled bullet list for exam tips |
| `window.SocComponents` | `B` | `<strong>` wrapper |
| `window.SocComponents` | `A` | External link (new tab) |
| `window.SocComponents` | `Code` | Inline code (`bg-gray-100 px-1.5 py-0.5`) |
| Inline | `Callout` | Amber-accent blockquote — copy verbatim from psap |
| Inline | `renderStars(rating)` | Converts `4.5` → `★★★★½☆` — copy verbatim from psap |

**Figure counter pattern:**
```js
// Inside App(), first line:
resetFigCount();
```
The hero image is NOT a `Fig`. Every other image in the markdown becomes one `<Fig>` in order.

**Ampersand in JS strings vs JSX attributes** — `&amp;` is only valid in JSX attribute string literals (Babel decodes it). Inside plain JS object literals (e.g., `tocItems` label strings), use `&` directly — `&amp;` will render literally as the string `&amp;`.

### 4d. Metadata fetch from reviews.json

```jsx
const [meta, setMeta] = useState(null);
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/data/reviews.json')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(data => {
      const entry = data.find(r => r.url === '/reviews/<slug>/index.html');
      if (entry) setMeta(entry);
    })
    .catch(() => {});
}, []);
```

Use `meta?.rating`, `meta?.difficulty`, `meta?.date`, `meta?.readTime` in the metadata strip. Render `—` as fallback. Never hardcode rating or difficulty in the HTML.

### 4e. Page structure (in order)

1. **Nav** — `Chicken0248 / Reviews / <Cert Name>` breadcrumb + dark mode toggle
2. **Hero** — cover image with `bg-gradient-to-t from-black/80`, title overlay, pill badges (provider, date, domain, Passed/Failed)
3. **Metadata strip** — 4-column: Certification, Provider, Difficulty (from meta), Rating (from meta with `renderStars`)
4. **Table of Contents** — one link per Section, using icon + number + label
5. **Content sections** — see rules below
6. **Footer** — "Back to top" + "All Reviews" (`/reviews/index.html`)

### 4f. Content rendering rules

| Markdown element | HTML output |
|---|---|
| `## Heading` | `<Section id="..." title="..." icon="...">` |
| `### Subheading` | `<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">` |
| Paragraph | `<p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">` |
| `> blockquote` | `<Callout>` with amber left border |
| `- bullet list` | `<ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-5 space-y-1 text-gray-700">` |
| Tips/takeaways list | `<TipList items={[...]} />` inside amber `bg-amber-50` card |
| `**bold**` | `<B>` component |
| `[text](url)` | `<A href="...">` for external, plain `<a>` for internal |
| `---` divider | Already handled by Section boundaries — omit or use `<hr className="border-gray-200 my-6" />` |
| Image | `<Fig src="<filename>" alt="<brief description>" />` |
| Emoji | Preserve as-is in JSX |

**Image position rule**: Every image from the markdown must appear in the HTML between the exact same surrounding content. If an image appears between paragraph A and paragraph B in the markdown, it must appear between those same paragraphs in the JSX. This is intentional layout — do not reorder.

### 4g. Section icon suggestions

| Section topic | Icon |
|---|---|
| Introduction / overview | `BookOpen` |
| Course / learning content | `GraduationCap` |
| Exam / assessment | `ClipboardList` |
| Final review / summary | `Star` |
| Tips / takeaways | `Lightbulb` |
| Pricing / what you get | `DollarSign` |
| Prerequisites / requirements | `ListChecks` |
| Lab / hands-on | `FlaskConical` |

If none fit, `FileText` is a safe default.

## Step 5 — Verify before finishing

Run these checks mentally:

- [ ] Count `<Fig` tags in HTML == count of non-hero images in markdown
- [ ] Every image filename referenced in `<Fig src="...">` exists in `reviews/<slug>/`
- [ ] `data/reviews.json` has an entry for this review
- [ ] Meta tags present in `<head>` with correct slug URLs
- [ ] Metadata strip uses `meta?.rating` and `meta?.difficulty`, not hardcoded values
- [ ] Nav breadcrumb shows correct cert name
- [ ] Hero uses the cover image (not a `<Fig>`)
- [ ] Dark mode CSS block is present

---

## Polishing pass

After generating the initial page, review the content for:

- **Prose quality** — fix grammar, awkward phrasing, or unclear sentences from the original export while preserving the author's voice and opinions. Do not change facts, ratings, or the author's judgments.
- **Consistency** — cert names, provider names, and acronyms should be spelled consistently throughout.
- **Link validity** — external links in `<A>` should look plausible. Flag any that look broken or placeholder-ish to the user.
- **Section balance** — if a section has only one short paragraph, flag it to the user rather than padding it.

Do not alter the meaning or sentiment of any review content. The author's voice is intentional.
